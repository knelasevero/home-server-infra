## How to build a simple but good home network with multiple VLANs

This course is aimed to assist anyone wanting to setup a more secure and more robust home network so you can avoid just connecting to you IPS' provided modem/router. You will also be able to segregate your network in multiple VLANs, allowing you to separate your personal devices from your servers and in the end give you more control over everything.

We will aim this guide at some specific devices and softwares, but you can adapt where needed. Please reach out if you run into problems.
